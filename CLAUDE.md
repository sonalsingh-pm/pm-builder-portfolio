# PM Builder Portfolio — CLAUDE.md

## Purpose
This is where I build my PM portfolio as a builder — not just a writer of PRDs.
The goal is to identify real problems, write PRDs, build functional prototypes,
test them, and publish them to GitHub. This demonstrates that I am an end-to-end
product builder, not just someone who hands specs to engineers.

Every project here should be something I'd be proud to show in a principal PM interview
at LinkedIn, Yelp, Shopify, or a late-stage startup.

## Commands and Their Skills

When a command is called, automatically read the files listed — no additional instructions needed in the prompt.

| Command | Read These Files Automatically | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `/brief [name]` | `skills/skill_brief.md` | `PRDs/[name]-brief.md` |
| `/discovery [name]` | `skills/skill_discovery.md` → `PRDs/[name]-brief.md` | `research/[name]-discovery.md` |
| `/prd [name]` | `skills/skill_prd.md` → `resources/prd-template.md` → `PRDs/campspark-prd.md` | `PRDs/[name].md` |
| `/prototype [name] Sprint [N]` | `skills/skill_prototype.md` → `user_stories/[name].md` → `PRDs/[name].md` — build only the sprint specified | `prototypes/[name]/index.html` |
| `/user-stories [name]` | `skills/skill_user_stories.md` → `PRDs/[name].md` | `user_stories/[name].md` |
| `/test-cases [name]` | `skills/skill_test_cases.md` → `user_stories/[name].md` | `test_cases/[name].md` |
| `/research-sync [name]` | `skills/skill_research_sync.md` → `PRDs/[name].md` | `research/[name].md` |
| `/case-study [name]` | `skills/skill_case_study.md` → `PRDs/[name].md` → `user_stories/[name].md` → `research/[name].md` | `case_studies/[name]-case-study.md` |

## Self-Improving Loop

Before starting any task:
1. Read `memory/rules.md` and apply all confirmed rules automatically
2. Check `memory/hypotheses.md` for relevant hypotheses to this domain
3. Do not ask permission to apply rules — just apply them

After completing any task where feedback is given:
1. Identify the pattern in the feedback
2. If confirmed pattern: add to `memory/rules.md`
3. If new observation: add to `memory/hypotheses.md`
4. If hypothesis disproven: move to `memory/rejected.md`

This happens automatically. No need to ask for it.

## Git and Deployment Rules

- Commit changes locally as needed, but do NOT push to GitHub automatically.
- Only push to GitHub when explicitly told: "push to GitHub" or "deploy."

---

## Hard Rules — Apply to Every Output

### PRDs
- Always read `skills/skill_prd.md` before writing any PRD
- Always use `resources/prd-template.md` as the structure
- Always use `PRDs/campspark-prd.md` as the quality calibration example
- Always include a Data Strategy section for any marketplace or discovery product
- Always include a Launch Readiness section with binary gates
- Always include an Assumptions Log with confidence levels
- Never use: "large and growing market," "no competition," "unique opportunity," "seamless experience"
- Business model must include illustrative unit economics — not just revenue stream names
- Time targets must be realistic — not aspirational

### Prototypes
- Always read `skills/skill_prototype.md` before building any prototype
- Single self-contained HTML file — no external dependencies except Google Fonts
- No placeholder text — all content must be real and relevant
- Primary user flow must work end to end
- Must feel like a real product — not a wireframe

### Case Studies
- Always read `skills/skill_case_study.md` before writing any case study
- Written in first person throughout
- At least 3 decisions with honest tradeoffs
- At least one surprising finding or course correction
- 900-1200 words

### Writing Style (All Outputs)
- Write at a principal PM level: strategic, specific, intellectually honest
- Numbers and specificity over adjectives
- Show tradeoffs: what you chose and what you gave up
- Assume the reader is a sophisticated hiring manager or CPO
- Clean Markdown unless another format is explicitly requested
- Never use em dashes (—) in any copy, descriptions, or content. Use commas, colons, or rephrase instead.

## How to Work on a New Problem

1. `/brief` → define the problem clearly
2. `/discovery` → customer interview guide, JTBD mapping, opportunity sizing
3. `/prd` → write the full PRD
4. `/user-stories` → write user stories
5. `/prototype` → build the HTML prototype
6. `/test-cases` → write test cases
7. Talk to real users, test the prototype
8. `/research-sync` → synthesize what you learned
9. Update PRD and prototype based on learnings
10. `/case-study` → write the case study markdown

---

## Quality Bar

Every project must answer these four questions before it is portfolio-ready:
1. What problem does this solve and for whom?
2. Why does this problem matter — what is the cost of not solving it?
3. What did I build and what were the key decisions?
4. What would I do differently or next?

If it cannot answer all four it is not ready for GitHub.

## Active Projects

### CampSpark — Summer Camp Discovery and Coordination
**Status:** PRD complete | Prototype live | Case study live
**PRD:** `PRDs/campspark-prd.md`
**User stories:** `user_stories/campspark-user-stories.md`
**Test cases:** `test_cases/campspark-test-cases.md`
**Prototype:** `prototypes/campspark/index.html`
**Case study:** `campspark-case-study.html` (deployed, do not move)
**Live URL:** https://sonalsingh-pm.netlify.app/prototypes/campspark/index.html

**What it is:** A desktop-first platform helping working parents discover summer camps, plan their child's summer, and coordinate with other parents — replacing the fragmented process of visiting dozens of websites and coordinating over group texts.

**Primary user:** Dual-income working parent, ages 35-50, 1-3 school-age children.

**Strategic differentiator:** The social coordination layer — parents can see where their children's friends are going and share summer plans with their network.

**Key constraints:**
- Desktop first — planning is a research-heavy sit-down activity
- Discovery only in MVP — does not own registration or payment
- Supply before demand — do not launch to parents until 200+ verified Bay Area listings exist

---

### NexTrade Aria — AI-Powered B2B Trade Intelligence
**Status:** PRD in progress
**PRD:** `PRDs/nexttrade-aria.md` ← next to build

---

## Portfolio Website

The portfolio website lives at `prototypes/index.html`.
It is deployed to Netlify and linked from Sonal's LinkedIn profile and resume.
Do not move this file — it will break the live URL.
Every completed project gets a card in the Projects section.
All prototype links must always work before any commit.
